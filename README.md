## How to install this plugin?

1. In your project install the plugin via `jspm` with following command

  ```shell
  jspm install aurelia-bs-modal
  ```
2. Make sure you use [manual bootstrapping](http://aurelia.io/docs#startup-and-configuration). In order to do so open your `index.html` and locate the element with the attribute aurelia-app. Change it to look like this:

  ```html
  <body aurelia-app="main">
  ...
  ```
3. Create (if you haven't already) a file `main.js` in your `src` folder with following content:

  ```javascript
  export function configure(aurelia) {
    aurelia.use
      .standardConfiguration()
      .developmentLogging()
      // Install the plugin
      .plugin('aurelia-bs-modal');

    aurelia.start().then(a => a.setRoot());
  }
  ```
4. Anywhere in your app add the following markup as a sample -

  ```html
  <modal showing.bind="showing">
    <modal-header title="Name Goes Here" close.call="closeEventGoesHere()"></modal-header>
    <modal-body content-view="view-model-path-goes-here" content-model.bind="model-name-goes-here"></modal-body>
    <modal-footer>
      <button class="btn" click.trigger="someFunctionGoesHere()">Save</button>
      <au-button text="Cancel" click.call="someFunctionGoesHere()"></au-button>
    </modal-footer>
  </modal>
  ```

(Note that when You don't want to close button in modal-header, then use `close.bind="false"` instead of `close.call="closeEventGoesHere()"` in modal-header)

5. Update the bindings to be events in the view model that backs whereever you added the sample -
  ```javascript
  export class MyViewModel{
    @bindable showing = false;
    closeEventGoesHere(){
      this.showing = false;
    }
    someFunctionGoesHere(){
      console.log('do stuff');
      this.showing = false;
    }

  }
  ```

  ## How to add buttons with behavior into footer

  ### au-button

  `au-button` is available through the aurelia-bs-modal plugin to have re-usable button logic free of presentiontation.  Make sure to `.call` the click binding instead of `trigger` it since we are passing a function reference.

  ### button

  You can just as easily choose your own buttons to render there as shown in the sample.

  ## How to change the content that shows

  ### Setting content

  Right now you can set the `content-view` property directly with the view-model name as shown in the example.  This will be a one-time setting of the property and lets the modal know which view-model / view you want to render.
  You can also (optionally) set the `content-model` property with the object that you want to act as the model to get data from to populate your view-model.

  ### Binding to content

  We can just as easily bind to that property to change the view-model mid-flight.  A good example of this would be when using a wizard and going through steps.  Ex -

  In your view-model
  ```javascript
  export class MyViewModel{
    this.modalContent = "./step1"
    changeStep(){
      this.modalContent = "./step2";
    }
  }
  ```
  ```html
  <modal-body content-view.bind="modalContent"></modal-body>
  ```
